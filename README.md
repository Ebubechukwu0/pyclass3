## Python Assignment Week 3

This project contains a Python script that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. If the discount percentage is 20% or higher, the discount is applied; otherwise, the original price is returned.

### Features

- Function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` to compute discounted prices.
- Example usage with hardcoded values.
- Interactive mode: prompts the user for input and displays the final price.

### Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```sh
   python pywk3.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to enter the original price and discount percentage.

### Example

```
Enter the original price of the item: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Final Price after 25.0% discount: $75.0
```

If the discount is less than 20%, the script will display the original price.

### File

- [pywk3.py](pywk3.py): Main script containing the discount calculation logic.
